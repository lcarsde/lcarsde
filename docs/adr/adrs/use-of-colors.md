## Context and Problem Statement

What colors shall be used for buttons, statistics and inactive elements considering usability. This concerns first and
foremost the tool applications.

## Considered Options

Base for decisions on any color distribution is [the color table shown in this linked image][1] with 8 colors.

The following list contains the colors hex-codes.
* #ff9900
* #cc99cc
* #9999cc
* #cc6666
* #ffcc99
* #9999ff
* #ff9966
* #cc6699

## Decision Outcome

Buttons or any usable elements should use the colors #ff9900, #9999ff, #cc6666 and #cc6699 as background and black text.

Displayed text should preferably be colored #ff9900 on black background. Other text colors may be used after consideration.

Graphs, diagrams and other status and statistical displays should use the colors #ffcc99, #9999cc, #9999ff and for warning purposes #ff9966, #ff9900 and #cc6666.

Design elements should use the colors #cc99cc, #9999cc and #ff9966. These colors are less "strong" and don't take as much attention.
